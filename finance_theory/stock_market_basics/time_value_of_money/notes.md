# Stock Market Basics
## Time Value of Money
Concept of money today is worth more than money tomorrow.
This is due to the impact of inflation increasing the costs of goods and services.

Investor A has $X USD.
They invest into treasury bills, stocks, or bonds.
By investing this money they get a premium, e.g. dividends from the company.
Can therefore come to the conclusion the money put into these sources is worth more tomorrow than today.

Example.
Investor A buys treasury bills (investing in a government).
The returns will be calculated by the money invested, the interest rate r, and the number of years investing for n.

## Future Value (FV)

FV is the value of a given asset at a specified date in the future based on an assumption growth rate over that
specified time.

PV = Present Value
r = interest rate
n = number of years

FV = PV * (1 + r)^n

This equation can be re-arranged to get to several different conclusions.
For example working out the PV required to reach a given FV, assuming a specific r and n value.

This is the discrete model. To work on the continuous model then we need to use differential equations.

x(t) - x amount of money at time t
x(t + d_T) - x(t) = d_x(t) / d_t * dt
=>
x(t + d_T) - x(t) = r x(t) dt
=>
dx(t) / dt = r x(t)
=> FV = PV * e^(r*t)

## Time value of money
Most important concept is that the time value of money today x(t) is worth more that x(t) in a years time.
